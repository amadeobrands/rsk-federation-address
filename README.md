# RSK Federation BTC Address tool

With this tool you can get the Federation address to send BTC (mainnet or testnet) in order to convert them to SBTC.

## How to use

You can use the module [RSKFederationAddress.js](.src/RSKFederationAddress.js), or just browse the [index.html](.dist/index.html) in the dist folder for a minimalist UI.

IMPORTANT: you need [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or similar tool in your browser to use the web version.
